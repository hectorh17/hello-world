# hello-world
This is my first repository.  I'm using it to learn GitHub


The last time I made changes and committed directly to the master branch, which was not what the instructions said.  I will make these changes to the read-me edit branch.

I haven't coded in quite some time.  I sit behind a desk and direct other IT professionals.  It would be nice to code again.

This is line number 3.  This branch will be merged into master later on.
