# hello-world
This is my first repository.  I'm using it to learn GitHub


The last time I made changes and committed directly to the master branch, which was not what the instructions said.  I will make these changes to the read-me edit branch.

I haven't coded in quite some time.  I sit behind a desk and direct other IT professionals.  It would be nice to code again.

I'm now comparing gitlab, github and bitbucket.
They all have some fine points.
GitLab is used by the Board.
